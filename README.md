![Telegram X Publisher](/images/cover.png)

This is the complete source code for the solution that automatically pulls the latest [Telegram X](https://github.com/TGX-Android/Telegram-X) commit, builds and publishes it to [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thunderdog.challegram), gives almost real-time build process updates in the [special channel](https://tgx_log) and [provides the way](https://t.me/tgx_bot) to check whether APK hash corresponds to any of the APKs built through this solution.

**This solution is made as a tool for the official [Telegram X source code](https://github.com/TGX-Android/Telegram-X) and is not designed to be used in other projects.**

The latest commit of this repository is used on the server without any modifications. While there's no technical way to provide a way to verify it, you can still use the [source code](/main.js) for research purposes and submit improvements through pull requests (e.g. adding automatic upload to alternative markets).
